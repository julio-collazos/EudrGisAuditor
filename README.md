<image src="./EudrGisAuditor.png"><image>

The **EUDR GIS Auditor** is a web-based tool designed to **validate, audit, and clean geospatial data**, specifically tailored to the requirements of the **European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)**. It processes common GIS file formats, identifies and fixes errors, and provides an **interactive dashboard and map** for thorough review.

## 🚀 Features

* **Geospatial Auditing** → Checks for geometry issues (e.g., self-intersections) and validates against standards like **WGS84**.
* **Automatic Fixes** → Corrects minor geometry errors to save you time.
* **Data Partitioning** → Classifies features as **valid**, **needs review**, or **conversion candidates** (e.g., small polygons → points).
* **Interactive Visualization** → Audit findings are displayed in a **dashboard** and on a **Leaflet-based map**, making flagged entities easy to inspect.

## ➡️ Roadmap / Next Steps

* 🔑 **User Authentication** → Add login system for managing sessions and data access.
* 📂 **Support Additional Formats** → Expand compatibility with more GIS formats.
* 🗄️ **Database Integration** → Store and manage audit results for long-term tracking.
* 🐳 **Production-Ready Docker** → Stabilize the container for reliable deployment in production environments (currently experimental).
